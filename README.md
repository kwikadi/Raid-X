Raid-X
======

Idea lifted directly from <a href= "https://github.com/iCHAIT/0xMirror">iChait's 0xMirror repo </a>, with some changes.

1. The script parses the File system, and creates an empty directory structure.
2. Files in the structure are represented as .txt files, with some basic information relating to them inside said .txt file.
3. Information available inside txt files is customisable.
4. User customisable on which drives to map.
5. GUI (eventually, and probably in PyQT).
