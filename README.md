Raid-X
======

Idea lifted directly from <a href= "https://github.com/iCHAIT/0xMirror">iChait's 0xMirror repo </a>, with some changes.

1. The script parses the entire File system, and creates an empty directory structure.
2. Files in the structure are represented as .txt files, with some basic information
3. Information available inside txt files is customisable.
